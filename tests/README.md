# Usage

## Git clone

You can deploy it easily with the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/elestio-examples/baserow.git

Copy the .env file from tests folder to the project directory

    cp ./tests/.env ./.env

Edit the .env file with your own values.

Create data folders with correct permissions

    mkdir -p ./storage/baserow_data
    mkdir -p ./storage/pgdata
    mkdir -p ./servers.json

    chown -R 1000:1000 ./storage/baserow_data
    chown -R 1000:1000 ./storage/pgdata
    chown -R 1000:1000 ./servers.json


Run the project with the following command

    docker-compose up -d

You can access the Web UI at: `http://your-domain:8284`

## Docker-compose

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

    version: "3.3"
    services:
    baserow:
        image: elestio4test/baserow:${SOFTWARE_VERSION_TAG}
        container_name: 'baserow'
        restart: always
        environment:
        BASEROW_PUBLIC_URL: "https://${DOMAIN}"
        DATABASE_HOST: db
        DATABASE_NAME: baserow
        DATABASE_USER: postgres
        DATABASE_PASSWORD: ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}
        DATABASE_PORT: 5432
        EMAIL_SMTP: "True"
        EMAIL_SMTP_HOST: ${EMAIL_SMTP_HOST}
        EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD: ${EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD}
        FROM_EMAIL: ${FROM_EMAIL}
        EMAIL_SMTP_USE_TLS: "False"
        ports:
        - "172.17.0.1:8725:80"
        volumes:
        - ./storage/baserow_data:/baserow/data

    db:
        image: elestio/postgres:15
        restart: always
        ports:
        - "172.17.0.1:5735:5432"
        environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: postgres
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}
        POSTGRES_DB: baserow
        volumes:
        - ./storage/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data/

    pgadmin4:
        image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
        restart: always
        environment:
        PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: ${ADMIN_EMAIL}
        PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}
        PGADMIN_LISTEN_PORT: 8080
        ports:
        - "172.17.0.1:8924:8080"
        volumes:
        - ./servers.json:/pgadmin4/servers.json

# Maintenance

## Logging

The Elestio Baserow Docker image sends the container logs to stdout. To view the logs, you can use the following command:

    docker-compose logs -f

To stop the stack you can use the following command:

    docker-compose down

## Backup and Restore with Docker Compose

To make backup and restore operations easier, we are using folder volume mounts. You can simply stop your stack with docker-compose down, then backup all the files and subfolders in the folder near the docker-compose.yml file.

Creating a ZIP Archive
For example, if you want to create a ZIP archive, navigate to the folder where you have your docker-compose.yml file and use this command:

    zip -r myarchive.zip .

Restoring from ZIP Archive
To restore from a ZIP archive, unzip the archive into the original folder using the following command:

    unzip myarchive.zip -d /path/to/original/folder

Starting Your Stack
Once your backup is complete, you can start your stack again with the following command:

    docker-compose up -d

That's it! With these simple steps, you can easily backup and restore your data volumes using Docker Compose.
